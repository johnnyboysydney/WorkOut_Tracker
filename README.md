## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.  
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.  
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.  
If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
